# Web Components

This repo is a place for me to store my custom web components.

Each sub-directory will be it's own web component. My goal is for each component to be available to load fully/directly via [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), or some similar thing.

## The components

* [`<code-block>`](./code-block)
* [scripture things](./scripture)
  * `<scripture-list>`
  * `<scripture-passage>`
      * `<scripture-reference>`
      * `<scripture-text>`
      * `<scripture-version>`
